# Cerebellar battery (track changes for final version)


## 1. General Changes - Implemented for all tasks (February 3, 2026)

- **Hand Preference Question:** 

Replaced the question regarding the less affected hand with "Which hand will the participant use to respond?". The answer to this question must be saved in the used_hand column of the output CSV.

- **Filename Formatting:** 

The output CSV filename now includes the date in YYYY_MM_DD format.

Example: For participant ctrl01, the generated results file will be: ctrl01_nBack_results_2026_02_03.csv.

- **Overwrite Protection (Versioning):**

 If the same participant ID is used more than once on the same date, the output CSV is not overwritten. Instead, a version suffix (_v2, _v3, etc.) is appended after the ID for subsequent runs.

-First run: ctrl01_nBack_results_2026_02_03.csv

--Second run: ctrl01_v2_nBack_results_2026_02_03.csv

Third run: ctrl01_v3_nBack_results_2026_02_03.csv

- **Task Column:**

 Added a new column named task at the beginning of the output CSV, containing the name of the specific task being executed.

- **End Screen:** 

The final screen ("Thank you for your participation") will now close the experiment upon pressing the spacebar or after 10 seconds have elapsed, whichever occurs first.

- **Vsync. Warning on RT accuracy:**

Due to the 60Hz monitor refresh rate, there is a potential ~16ms lag between the software command and the actual stimulus display. To correct this, I have enabled V-Sync (vsync=1). This ensures pygame.display.flip() waits for the screen refresh before starting the timer (trial_start), synchronizing the code with the visual output. Without V-Sync, our timing would start prematurely.

I did this in the init_display function. Let’s keep it this way for all tasks, please.


## 2. N-Back Updates (February 3, 2026)

- **Fixation Cross:** 

Added a fixation cross during the Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI).

- **Fixed Timing (Jaeggi et al., 2010):** 

The stimulus (500 ms) and the fixation cross (2500 ms) now remain on screen for their full duration, even if a response is registered. Pressing the spacebar does not interrupt the display of these elements.

- **Smart Feedback Timing:**

Immediate feedback: Triggered when the participant responds (any time within the 3000ms window).

Delayed feedback: Displayed when there is no response to targets (appears in the last 500ms of the 3000ms window).

Maximized response opportunity: Full 3000ms uninterrupted response time allowed for missed targets.

Standard feedback duration: Set to 500ms for optimal visibility.
