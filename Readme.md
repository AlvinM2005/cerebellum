# Progress Report (Sep 12, 2025)

## 1. Bidimensional Mental Rotation (BMR)
- **Updated instructions**
  - [ ] Need estimation of time costs for each section (currently using place holder “lasts about X minutes”)
  - [ ] Need reversed instructions (saved for later, after agreeing on the final version of the task)
- [ ] Need new stimuli (in black) (preferably directly edit the `images` folder without changing the sequence, because we do **not** have the python files that generate condition files / sort stimuli images anymore)
- Transition screens between block automatically applied (“Trials completed! …” + “Remember, …”)

## 2. Tridimensional Mental Rotation (TMR)
- **Updated instructions**
  - [ ] Need estimation of time costs for each section (currently using place holder “lasts about X minutes”)
  - [ ] Need reversed instructions (saved for later, after agreeing on the final version of the task)

## 3. Actions Prediction (AP)
- **Updated instructions**
  - [ ] Need estimation of time costs for each section (currently using place holder “lasts about X minutes”)
  - [ ] Need reversed instructions (saved for later, after agreeing on the final version of the task)
- Transition screens between block automatically applied (“Trials completed! …” + “Remember, …”)
- [ ] Currently there are no video for test3 / test4 (so no more tests after block 2). Should I select some new ones for them?

## 4. Cognitive Control
- Merged with my version (enabled automatic VERSION selection)
  - Fixed multiple bugs in `motor.py` / `sensorimotor.py` / `contextual.py` / `main.py`
  - Corrected answers for different versions (previously all versions had the same answer)
  - [ ] Pre-mature error is not treated as an error anymore — is this on purpose or should I fix it?
- [ ] Need estimation of time costs for each section (currently using place holder “lasts about X minutes”)
- [ ] Need reversed instructions (saved for later, after agreeing on the final version of the task)

## 5. Tapping
- Directly applied my fixed version from last meeting (should be okay to use!)
